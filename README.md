# iTunes Song Renamer
A short python script to rename songs copied from an iPod.

## How to use
1. Connect your iPod to your computer (I used a PC).
2. Open file explorer and navigate to the base directory of your iPod's drive.
3. Navigate to "/iPod_control/Music".
4. Copy all of these F number (ex. F00, F01) to a folder on your computer. Best bet would be into an input folder (ex. C:/iTunesConversion/input).
5. Update your base_dir to point to the top level folder that contains your input folder (if using the example above, point to "c:/iTunesConversion")
6. Install script requirements
7. Run the script
